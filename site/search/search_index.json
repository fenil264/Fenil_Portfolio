Sales and profit showed a moderate positive correlation (0.48), indicating that higher sales can lead to higher profits, though not always. More importantly, there was a weak negative correlation (\u20130.22) between discount and profit, suggesting that increasing discounts tends to reduce profitability. Other variable pairs showed negligible correlation, meaning no strong direct linear relationships exist among them. This pattern directly points to a potential issue in the business strategy \u2014 discounts may not be delivering the intended profitability boost, which sets the stage for hypothesis testing.</p> <pre><code>plt.figure(figsize=(7, 5))\nsns.scatterplot(data=df, x='Discount', y='Profit', alpha=0.4)\nplt.title(\"Discount vs. Profit\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Discount\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Profit\")\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Further exploration using a scatter plot of discount vs. profit confirmed this suspicion. At 0% discount, the spread of profit values was wide, including several highly profitable transactions. However, at discount levels between 0.2 and 0.8, profits consistently declined, and many entries dropped into deep negative territory. This suggests that excessive discounting may not only fail to incentivize profitable behavior but could actively harm margins. This pattern is a compelling foundation for a focused \u201cDiscount Abuse Pattern\u201d analysis.</p> <pre><code>plt.figure(figsize=(7, 5))\nsns.scatterplot(data=df, x='Sales', y='Profit', alpha=0.4)\nplt.title(\"Sales vs. Profit\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Sales\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Profit\")\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>A separate scatter plot of sales vs. profit revealed a triangular distribution. Most transactions clustered in the low-sale, low-profit range, while some high-sale entries still ended in loss, highlighting that strong revenue does not automatically translate into strong profit. This supports the concept of profit leakage, where certain high-revenue items or regions might be underperforming in terms of actual financial return.</p> <pre><code>plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))\nsns.boxplot(data=df, x='Segment', y='Profit')\nplt.title(\"Profit Distribution by Customer Segment\")\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Boxplot of profit distribution by customer segment (Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office) showed similar median profits across all segments. However, each segment had numerous extreme outliers on both ends of the profit scale, including significant losses. This indicates that no segment is immune to unprofitable transactions, and high-risk behavior is spread across the board. It further implies that broad segmentation is not sufficient \u2014 deeper analysis at the intersection of region, product category, and discount level will likely yield more actionable insights.</p>"},{"location":"da/eda-cleaning/#step-3-defining-hypothesis","title":"Step 3: Defining hypothesis","text":"<p>Based on the patterns identified during exploratory data analysis, we formulated several business-focused hypotheses aimed at uncovering inefficiencies and hidden risks in the company's retail strategy. The first hypothesis addresses profit leakage, suggesting that certain product sub-categories or geographic regions may generate high sales yet consistently yield low or even negative profit. This would indicate operational inefficiencies or poor pricing structures that mask underlying losses.</p> <p>The second hypothesis revolves around a discount abuse pattern, based on the observation that higher discounts, especially those exceeding 30%, often correspond to sharp declines in profitability. This raises the possibility that discounting, instead of boosting volume or customer retention, is eroding margins without generating meaningful returns \u2014 a critical area for revenue protection.</p> <p>The third hypothesis focuses on inventory optimization. By analyzing order quantities and shipping delays across product categories, we suspect that certain items are more prone to late fulfillment or stockouts. This inefficiency may lead to lost sales or poor customer experience, and highlights the need for more strategic restocking cycles.</p> <p>Lastly, the time-to-profit hypothesis investigates how long it takes for a customer to become profitable. By analyzing the cumulative profit timeline per customer, we aim to identify segments or regions that require longer lead time to break even. This insight can inform smarter investments in marketing, onboarding, and retention strategies by focusing on faster-returning customer groups.</p>"},{"location":"da/eda-cleaning/#hypothesis-1-profit-leakage","title":"Hypothesis 1: Profit Leakage","text":"<p>\u201cSome product sub-categories or regions generate high sales but consistently result in low or negative profit, indicating potential leakage.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"da/eda-cleaning/#11-create-a-new-feature-profit-margin","title":"1.1) Create a new feature: Profit Margin","text":"<pre><code># Profit margin = profit as a percentage of sales\ndf['Profit Margin'] = df['Profit'] / df['Sales']\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"da/eda-cleaning/#12-group-data-by-category-sub-category-and-region","title":"1.2) Group data by Category, Sub-Category, and Region","text":"<pre><code># Group by Category, Sub-Category, and Region\ngrouped = df.groupby(['Category', 'Sub-Category', 'Region']).agg({\n    'Sales': 'sum',\n    'Profit': 'sum',\n    'Profit Margin': 'mean'\n}).reset_index()\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"da/eda-cleaning/#13-sort-to-spot-problem-areas-low-or-negative-profit-with-high-sales","title":"1.3) Sort to spot problem areas (low or negative profit with high sales)","text":"<pre><code># Sort by Sales and Profit to catch high-volume low-profit areas\ngrouped_sorted = grouped.sort_values(by=['Sales', 'Profit'], ascending=[False, True])\n</code></pre> <pre><code># Show the top 15 potential profit leakage zones\ngrouped_sorted.head(15)\n</code></pre> Category Sub-Category Region Sales Profit Profit Margin 7 Furniture Chairs West 101781.328 4027.5843 0.021498 65 Technology Phones East 100614.982 12314.6860 0.089939 67 Technology Phones West 98684.352 9110.7426 0.085740 5 Furniture Chairs East 96260.683 9357.7706 0.063061 4 Furniture Chairs Central 85230.646 6592.7221 0.004443 15 Furniture Tables West 84754.562 1482.6073 -0.053966 64 Technology Phones Central 72403.282 12323.0267 0.166875 45 Office Supplies Storage East 71612.584 8389.3712 0.096746 47 Office Supplies Storage West 70532.852 8645.3222 0.132321 61 Technology Machines East 66106.165 6928.6429 -0.176847 55 Technology Accessories West 61114.116 16484.5983 0.241386 66 Technology Phones South 58304.438 10767.2753 0.174286 24 Office Supplies Binders Central 56923.282 -1043.6369 -0.859399 27 Office Supplies Binders West 55961.113 16096.8016 0.166587 62 Technology Machines South 53890.960 -1438.8930 0.012778"},{"location":"da/eda-cleaning/#14-visualize-profit-margin-by-sub-category","title":"1.4) Visualize profit margin by sub-category","text":"<pre><code>plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nsns.barplot(data=grouped.sort_values(by='Profit Margin'), \n            x='Sub-Category', y='Profit Margin', hue='Region')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.title(\"Average Profit Margin by Sub-Category and Region\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n</code></pre> <p>The chart shows how much profit each product sub-category makes on average, across different regions.
