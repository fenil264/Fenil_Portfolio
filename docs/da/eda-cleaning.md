## 🔍 Business Hypotheses & Findings

1. **Do high discounts lead to lower profits?**  
    Yes — especially in Technology and Furniture. Excessive discounting erodes margins.

2. **Are certain sub-categories consistently loss-making?**  
    Yes — *Tables* and *Bookcases* regularly yield negative profits across multiple regions.

3. **Which segments and regions perform best?**  
    The *Consumer* segment has high sales but modest profits.  
    *West* and *East* regions consistently outperform *Central*.

4. **Are there seasonal profit patterns?**  
    Profit dips during Q2. High returns and discounts appear during mid-year sales events.
