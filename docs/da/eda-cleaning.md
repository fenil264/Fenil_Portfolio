2. **Are certain sub-categories consistently loss-making?**  
   ✅ Yes — *Tables* and *Bookcases* regularly yield negative profits across multiple regions.

3. **Which segments and regions perform best?**  
   ✅ The *Consumer* segment has high sales but modest profits.  
   ✅ *West* and *East* regions consistently outperform *Central*.

4. **Are there seasonal profit patterns?**
